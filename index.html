                    <div class="col-md-8">
                        <p>My first experiences with technology included gaming on the boxy PC and when I learned that I
                            could play a part in the things that gave me so much joy, you can bet that I customised my
                            Neopets profile with a fairy wand cursor. Curiousity played a large part in my interest in
                            tech and changing that single cursor design lead me down a path of developing interfaces for
                            friends to use, programming a robotic arm, and volunteering to help spark that same
                            curiousity and enthusiasm in others.
                            <br><br>
                            I want to move forward by persisting in developing my abilities, diving into the knowledge
                            of others, and providing my own perspective too.

                            People have always been at the center of my work and I would love the opportunity to be a
                            part of a team that helps create a positive impact on how information is used, communicated,
                            and shared.

                            People are constantly changing: whether it's the technology they use, their teams they work
                            with, or even their ideas. I hope to collaborate and bring my perspective of inclusion,
                            accessibility, and sustainability when developing strategies or products - or both!
                            <br><br>
                            It's not easy to summarise all the things I want to work on - but it is easy for me to say
                            that I would love a change to work together with you to build something valuable.

Code Club volunteering has lead me to help young students learn about software development for their projects. These experiences have developed my ability in troubleshooting issues and finding ways to communicate them in a way the user can understand - this has now also translated in communicating the strategies I develop to other teams and how I present data. My work is always adapted to be personal using clear language so that ideas can be turned into real solutions.</p>

Through my roles, I've learned the importance of collaboration to promote a supportive work culture and to provide the best experience for our users. I believe in cultivating an environment where everyone is comfortable and safe, where sharing their ideas and asking questions is encouraged because this is how I also grew to develop my own skills. </p>

I'm always excited to pick up new skills to provide insight and solutions the best I can. This drive to keep asking why, investigating the details, and take in multiple perspectives has meant I've been able to start creating my own projects and solutions in my current role. While I might not have all the answers, I'll have the motivation to learn how to find them.</p>
